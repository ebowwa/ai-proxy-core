Original prompt:

            Generate a modern app icon for a privacy-focused camera application:
            - Turquoise/teal gradient background (#00AFAA to #00CFCC)
            - White camera icon in center
            - Japanese text "クリーンショット" (Clean Shot in Katakana) in clean, modern font below the camera
            - Small sparkle accent for privacy
            - Professional appearance
            - iOS app store style with rounded corners
            - Japanese text should be clearly readable with appropriate font weight
            

Revised prompt:
Create a modern app icon with a professional look, appropriate for a privacy-focused camera application. Use a gradient background that transitions from turquoise (#00AFAA) at one end to teal (#00CFCC) at the other. In the middle of this background, place a white camera icon. Beneath the camera, add the Japanese text, 'クリーンショット,' translated as 'Clean Shot,' in a clear modern font that is easy to read. Add a small sparkle accent to suggest privacy. The icon should match the style used in the iOS app store, including its characteristic rounded corners. The weight of the font used for the Japanese text should be proportionate and adds to its readability.
